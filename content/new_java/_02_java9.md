# Java 9

## JShell

- The Java Shell tool (JShell) is an interactive tool for learning the Java programming language and prototyping Java code.
- JShell is a Read-Evaluate-Print Loop (`REPL`), which evaluates declarations, statements, and expressions as they are entered and immediately shows the results.
- The tool is run from the command line.
- **Using JShell, you can enter program elements one at a time, immediately see the result, and make adjustments as needed.**
- You can use Java to write scripts!

## Modules
(Java 9 Platform Module System - `JPMS`)

> **Modularity adds a higher level of aggregation above `package`s.**

- The key new language element is the `module`:
  - a uniquely named, reusable group of related packages, as well as resources (such as images and XML files) and a module descriptor specifying.

## Private interface Methods

```java{}
public interface MyInterface {

    void normalInterfaceMethod();

    default void interfaceMethodWithDefault() {  init(); }

    default void anotherDefaultMethod() { init(); }

    // This method is not part of the public API exposed by MyInterface
    private void init() { System.out.println("Initializing"); }
    
    // This method is not part of the public API exposed by MyInterface
    private static void doSomething() { System.out.println("Doing Something!"); }
}
```

## Collection Factory Methods

```java{}

Set<Integer> ints = Set.of(1, 2, 3);
List<String> strings = List.of("first", "second");

```
