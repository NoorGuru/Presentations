    - A new Java release every six months. The March 2018 release is JDK 10, the September 2018 release is JDK 11, and so forth. These are called feature releases and are expected to contain at least one or two significant features
    - Support for the feature release will last only for six months, i.e., until next feature release
    - Long-term support release will be marked as LTS. Support for such release will be for three years

- Java 11 will be an LTS release
